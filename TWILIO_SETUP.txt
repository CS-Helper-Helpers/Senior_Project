Setup for Twilio:

1. Set up ngrok (might use something else later)
  Make sure ngrok.exe is in the Phone folder.
  Run the following command: ngrok authtoken 1YGyhiurStHds1fX7Ccnne7Mjog_6c26eJqUCmyChaootCqNy
  It should output Authtoken saved to configuration file: C:\pathname

2. Set up Twilio
  Go into the app folder.
  Open up a terminal in this folder.
  Run the following commands:
    node -v
    npm install twilio-cli -g
    twilio login

  This will prompt you to input the Account SID and Auth token for the Twilio
  account. It may ask you to provide a friendly name, I used CS Helper. These
  can be found in the dashboard of our Twilio account, the login information
  can be found in Slack.

3. Running a subdomain on ngrok
  The server must be running before testing. In order to do this, navigate out
  of the app folder back into the Phone folder.

  Run the following command:
    ngrok http -hostname=cshelper.ngrok.io 8080

  This will start the subdomain that I have reserved on port 8080.
