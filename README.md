## Voice Assistant: CS Helper

### Background
The New Mexico State University Computer Science Department employs a student worker for up to 20 hours of work per week. However, the office within the Computer Science Department is open for 40 hours per week, leaving at least 20 hours of week unmanned. During this time, there is no one to answer questions for students, faculty, and the like. Alongside having no one to answer student questions, CS Helper can assist with training new student workers. A student worker is a short-term worker, meaning they might only work for a semester. New student workers need to be able to answer questions such as:
Where is CS448 located?
What is the last day to drop a class?
How do I apply to the graduate program?
Training a student-worker to effectively communicate these answers may be time-consuming and often the employee does not acquire the necessary knowledge until the end of their time in the CS department.  Questions about classes, buildings, and important dates are examples of topics that CS Helper will be able to answer.

### Purpose of Product
The CS Helper will answer frequently asked questions in person and over the phone, through the userâ€™s voice or text input. The assistant will be able to respond using audio and visual components as well by using a speaker and a screen. The CS Helper will be more accessible to users by providing audio/visual feedback rather than simply audio or simply visual feedback.

### Scope of Product
To describe the scope of work, we separate CS Helper into distinct sections: 1) core functionality, 2) in-office behavior and 3) phone behavior. In-office behavior requires our assistant to interact with a user directly through the device. The phone behavior requires our assistant to interact with a user through a phone line. The core functionality are all behaviors that are shared between the other two, like taking a request, processing it, and giving an answer back.
